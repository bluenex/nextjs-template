# bluenex-storybook

This is a repository to keep potentially reusable components that I have implemented. I have no skill in design at all so some of them might be dull. Also, it may or may not follow the best practice, but consistency will be my priority.

I personally enjoy writing components with styled-components. However, I discovered Chakra UI recently and think it provides an intuitive styled system that helps me a lot. So I am personally attached to these 2 libraries and so that I include them in this repository.

This repository can also be used as a template for a new project with Next.js + TypeScript + Chakra UI.

## Requirements

- Node 16+

## Stacks

- Next.js + TypeScript
- Chakra UI

## Create a new project

To create a new project from this template, run the following command:

 ```

## Dev

To run the development server for Next.js:
